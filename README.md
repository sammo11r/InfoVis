# InfoVis
The final goal of this project was to produce an interactive and web-based visualization tool used to highlight and explore visual scanning patterns of users attempting to solve tasks involving a static stimulus. In order to illuminate the effectiveness of such a tool, real-world eye tracking data (concerning a repertoire of metro maps as visual stimuli) from a previously conducted experiment was explored. Viewing data in this way allowed for comprehensive identification of common scanning patterns within the sample of users, which was the intended goal of the tool. Visualizations were enhanced with the inclusion of numerous interaction techniques and alternate views. The website itself prioritizes the user experience, with a variety of quality-of-life features; being web-based comes with its own set of advantages, notably allowing users to upload data sets, conduct explorations, and share results to relevant parties as needed. <br >
